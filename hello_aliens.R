cat("Hello aliens,
I'm a human from planet Earth. We, human beings,
live on land, and walk on two feet. We start as babies, and grow into
adults, and live in family structures, like many other animals do. We
aren't the only animals inhabiting Earth. We live in a civilized world,
usually inside buildings to protect ourselves from the crazy weather 
outside. How is your planet? Do you live outside? Or have you built
something to live inside of? What kinds of food do you eat to stay alive?
I was also wondering, what is your population? 
Best,
Sophia")
